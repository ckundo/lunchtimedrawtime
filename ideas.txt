a man on a horse
an elephant
your dream house
your spirit animal
autumn leaves
a dinosaur
you in a past life
a tropical paradise
first contact with aliens
a trip to the zoo
sea creatures
your first summer job
something outside your window
people sitting on a bench
a sad clown
a canoe on a river
a still-life with a bottle
a man crying
a magician
cave paintings
a bird
flowers in a bunch
your favorite food
a battlefield
a bowl of fruit
a portrait of someone in the room
a self portrait
your hand clenched into a fist
while listening to Beethoven's 9th symphony. Bah bah bah bahhh
a person in a gas mask
a teddy bear
a hippo
a man smoking a cigar
a lady in a hat
a pair of heavy boots
